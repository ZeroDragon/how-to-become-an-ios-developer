# How to become an iOS Developer
The propose of this document is the creation of a repository with information about how to start and grow in my career becoming an expert iOS developer. Also, this document could works as an interview guide to cover the most important topics.

## ⚠️Disclaimer⚠️
The following information is **work in progress**. Feel free to create a pull request if you think a topic/tutorial/course is important to be here.

# Two sides
Let's divide the roadmap in two major topics:
* [Computer Science](#computer-science)
This topic is frequently ignored by some developers thinking that mobile devs "don't need" to build complex algorithms. This is a wrong assumption. If you want to become the best developer (doesn't matter the language or platform), you should study algorithms and know the most used data structures very well.

* [iOS](#ios)
iOS world is vast. There are a lot of topics to learn from Cocoa/Cocoa Touch, design patterns, software architectures and of course, Swift and Objective-C languages. This guide will help you to focus and find a way to study all those concepts.

# iOS
The following list include the most important concepts you should know in order to develop apps for iOS:
* [Languages](#languages)

## Languages
iOS Support two languages: Objective-C (used for two decades) and Swift from 2014. You can create apps with a single of these languages or mix them if it's convinient. Nowadays, Apple take Swift as its main language for development, however, there are a lot of legacy apps that still require support from Objective-C (because is expensive and time consuming doing a migration), that's why it's important to know both of them. If you are new and wonder where to start, I recommend you to start with Swift, because it's well robust and supported today, keep it as the main language to develop iOS apps, but also keep knowledge of Objective-C, that will help you in interviews or situations when you require to interact with it.
