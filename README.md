The following information is work in progress. Feel free to create a pull request if you think a topic/tutorial/course is important to be here.

# Two sides
Let's divide the roadmap in two major topics:
* [Computer Science](#computer-science)
This topic is frequently ignored by some developers thinking that mobile devs "don't need" to build complex algorithms. This is a wrong assumption. If you want to become the best developer (doesn't matter the language or platform), you should study algorithms and know the most used data structures very well.

* [iOS](#ios)
iOS world is vast. There are a lot of topics to learn from Cocoa/Cocoa Touch, design patterns, software architectures and of course, Swift and Objective-C languages. This guide will help you to focus and find a way to study all those concepts.
